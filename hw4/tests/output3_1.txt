Filled container:
Container contains 6 elements.
0: It is Complex: x = 1000, y = 2000.
 Converted to Real = 5e+06

1: It is Fraction: a = 1000, b = 2000.
 Converted to Real = 0.5

2: It is Polar: a = 2000, b = 3000.
 Converted to Real = 3000

3: It is Complex: x = 2000, y = 1000.
 Converted to Real = 5e+06

4: It is Fraction: a = 2000, b = 1000.
 Converted to Real = 2

5: It is Polar: a = 2000, b = 1000.
